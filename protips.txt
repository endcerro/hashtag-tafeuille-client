middleman run


Pro tips : 

Middleman serv can be killed as soon as the countdown started, giving you time to make the adjustements for the next round but leave the node serv running

At the end of the countdown, kill node serv, launch middleman serv, refresh page (watch out for incmplete refreshes, ctrl F5 in firefox does the trick) and launch node serv when ready.

Good luck, practice b4 prime time !
